1.  Introduction

   In the IP address architecture, a loopback address is a special IP
   address used by hosts to send data to itself.  Packets directed to a
   loopback address are automatically routed back to the sending host’s
   network software stack without ever reaching the physical network
   interface.  This has use in some forms of testing and is used to
   support a non-network method to facilitate local inter-process
   communication within a host.

   This document updates the IP Version 6 Address Architecture to define
   the IPv6 address prefix ::/96 as the Loopback address prefix.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Loopback addresses

   The IPv4 network 127.0.0.0/8 was reserved by the IANA in [RFC791]
   where tha class-based address architecture was described.  It is
   understood that it was the IANA's policy at the time to reserve the
   first and last network of each class, and the address prefixes
   0.0.0.0/8 and 127.0.0.0/8 from the Class A space were reserved in
   accordance with this practice.  [RFC990] listed the 127.0.0.0/8
   address prefix as being used by the loopback function, and this
   function was listed as a requirement for all Internet hosts in
   [RFC1122].

   The "loopback" function is defined such that an outbound packet whose
   destination address triggers this loopback function should loop the
   packet back to the packet ingress queue for processing by the same
   host.  No packet that is addresses to a loopback address should ever
   to passed to any network.

   [RFC1884], the original IPv6 Addressing Architecture document,
   allocates a single local loopback address, ::1.  This single address
   allocation has been preserved in all subsequent revision to the IPv6
   addressing specification ([RFC2373], [RFC3513], [RFC4291])

   Loopback addresses enable localhost communication, network
   diagnostics, and inter-process connections, making them essential for
   various local functions.

   Multiple loopback addresses can increase the number of distinct
   sockets that can be used for inter-process communication within a
   host.  A larger local loopback address prefix in IPv6 can permit
   large numbers of distinct concurrent loopback TCP connections within
   a single host, which is comparable the the functionality supported by
   the IPv4 loopback address prefix.

4.  The IPv6 Loopback Prefix

   The IANA IPv6 Address registry denotes the address prefix ::/8 as
   being reserved by the IETF in [RFC3513] [RFC4291].  This range has
   been partially allocated with the prefix ::FFFF:0:0/96 being used in
   the context of an IPv6 transition technology to map IPv4 addresses
   into IPv6 addresses.

   The document expands the set of IPv6 loopback addresses to span the
   address prefix range ::0 through to ::FFFF:FFFF (or ::/96 in prefix
   notation).

   This RFC replaces section 2.5.2 and 2.5.3 of [RFC4291] as follows:

      The Loopback prefix

      The unicast address prefix ::/96 is called the loopback address
      prefix.

      The first address of this address prefix block, 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
      (::/128), is also termed the "unspecified address".  This address
      MUST NOT be assigned to any node, as it indicates the absence of
      an address.  One example of the use of this address is in the
      Source Address field of any IPv6 packets sent by an initializing
      host before it has learned its own address.

      All other loopback addresses drawn from this loopback address
      prefix may be used by a node as a destination address to send an
      IPv6 packet to itself.  These addresses MUST NOT be assigned to
      any physical interface.  These addresses are treated as having
      Link-Local scope, and may be thought of as the Link-Local unicast
      address prefix of a virtual interface (typically called the
      "loopback interface") to an imaginary link that goes nowhere.

      All loopback addresses other than the unspecified address MUST NOT
      be used as the source address in IPv6 packets that are sent
      outside of a single node.  An IPv6 packet with a destination
      address of loopback address MUST NOT be sent outside of a single
      node and must never be forwarded by an IPv6 router.  A packet
      received on an interface with a destination loopback address MUST
      be dropped.

   ((Geoff: I have gone for proposing a simple prefix that sits below
   the IPv4-mapped address block of 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF::/96 - the
   complication is that the prefix then includes the "unspecified
   address" as well, so the RFC4291 text relating to the unspecificed
   address is reproduced in this proposed amendment, as this text
   proposes replacing the entirety of sections 2.5.2 and 2.5.3 of
   RFC4291.))

5.  Security Considerations

   IPv6 addressing documents do not have any direct impact on Internet
   infrastructure security.

   ((WK: I don't think that we need to add anything about the
   "Unspecified Address", nor the behavior of "packets with source
   address of ::" since this is already covered in RFC 4291, but figured
   I'd mention it here for completeness.))

6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to amend the IPv6 Address registry and the IPv6
   Special Purpose Address registry to record the designation of the
   IPv6 address prefix ::/96 as denoting the IPV6 Loopback function.
